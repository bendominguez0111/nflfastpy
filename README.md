# Usage 
### Loading Play by Play Data

Play by play data is available going back to 1999.

```Python
import nflfastpy

df = nflfastpy.load_pbp_data(year=2021)
```
<br>

### Loading Roster Data

Roster data comes with player headshots. Rookies are not included in roster data as roster data is only available up to 2021. To account for this, a variable is available in the module called `nflfastpy.default_headshot` that is a numpy array representation of a default player headshot.


```Python
roster_df = nflfastpy.load_roster_data()
```

### Joining Roster Data and Team Logo Data with Play by Play Data
To join roster data with play by play data, player id's in the play by play data must be converted to the old GSIS ID. The helper function in `nflfastpy.utils.convert_to_gsis_id` accomplishes this. Check out the file named "Roster Data and Team Logo Data.ipynb" under the examples folder to see how to use the function.

### Loading Schedule Data

Schedule data is available from 1999 to 2021.

```Python
schedule = nflfastpy.load_schedule_data(year=2021)
```
